## Introduction

  In 2019, human beings experiences an unprecedented outbreak of COVID 19. The total number of global deaths in 2020 is "at least 3 million, representing 1.2 million more deaths than officially reported." At the beginning of the outbreak, people didn't expect it to last for a long time and treated it like a common flu. However, because the infected person is exposed to the crowd for a long time, the development of new coronary pneumonia is out of control and gradually forms a global disease. Thus, it becomes meaningful to control the spread of the virus from the human body itself, and vaccination is one of them. The effective vaccines can greatly reduce "diseases that once routinely harmed or killed babies, children, and adults."
  
  BNT162b2 vaccine, the two-dose COVID 19 vaccine developed by Pfizer, has entered public's view. Based on the research provided by the article "Safety and Efficacy of the BNT162b2 mRNA COVID 19 Vaccine" by Polack et al, individuals aged 16 years or older were randomly divided into two groups to receive two doses of either a placebo or the BNT162b2 vaccine. Then, by analyzing the data of infection cases recorded from the article, we will use 3 statistical methods (likelihood, Bayesian, and bootstrapping) to test whether the BNT162b2 vaccine efficacy is greater than 30% in the following sections.
